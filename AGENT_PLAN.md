# Agent Development Plan

## Action plan

- [ ] For Multiple Choice questions, modify the json files so that they store the literal text of the correct answer, instead of the letter (A, B, C, D). This will make it easier to maintain the files, as shuffling the answers will not require updating the correct answer letter.
- [ ] Create a small standalone script that validates that for multiple choice questions, the correct answer text is among the possible answers. This script can be run as part of a CI/CD pipeline to ensure question files are well formed before deployment. The files to check will be in areas.json.
- [ ] LocalStorage is not deleted on iPhone when using the option to Empezar de nuevo. Validate in iPhone and iPad.
- [ ] Application does not work on uned/tests withouth a trailing slash. Fix routing to work with and without trailing slash.
- [ ] Package the application with webpack or similar for production deployment.
- [ ] Separate application from JSON data files for better organization and ease of maintenance.
- [ ] For Multiple Choice quesitions, there could be an arbitrary number of possible answers, not only 3. If there are 2, show only A and B. If there are 4, show A, B, C and D. If more options, increase the number of letters accordingly.
- [ ] For Multiple Choice questions, the possible answers should be shown in random order each time the question is presented. The correct answer must be adjusted accordingly. Consider adding optionality in the menu to shuffle answers or not.
- [ ] In localStorage we are storing currentArea, quizStatus_[ByArea], questionOrder_[ByArea] and currentQuestion_[ByArea]. Consider storing all quiz related data under a single key "unedTestsData" to avoid cluttering localStorage with multiple keys.
- [ ] LocalStorage is not cleared with Volver a empezar in iPhone. Test and fix it.
- [ ] humblyproud.com/uned/tests does not work without final slash. humplyproud.com/uned/tests/ works.
- [ ] Add new JSON field for "appearsIn" containing an array of the sections (exams or topics) where the question appears. Currently it is only in IPC questions, as part of the text and it could be formatted in the JSON file, but it is more maintainable to have it as a separate field.

## Development Guidelines

- Before starting a new feature, create a branch named `feature/short-description` from `main`.
- Apply TDD. Always write a breaking test before implementing a new feature. Use Red-Green-Refactor cycle. In the Refactor step, update AGENT_PLAN.md to reflect the progress, tick off completed items, and add new items as needed. After the step is finished, commit the changes with a descriptive message. Tests can be implemented using Playwright E2E tests or unit tests as appropriate.
- Always run Playwright tests with `--reporter=list` for clear output and easier cancellation.
- Set Playwright test timeout to 5 seconds for fast feedback. (See playwright.config.ts: `timeout: 3000`)
- Example: `npx playwright test tests/area-navigation.spec.ts --project=chromium --reporter=list`
- If a test run hangs, use Ctrl+C to cancel, then re-run with the correct reporter flag.
- Always add new feature suggestions to AGENT_PLAN before implementation
- Always write or update Playwright tests before implementing new features (TDD)
- Always update AGENT_PLAN after completing a feature or test
- Make all Playwright tests pass: Review and fix all failing Playwright E2E tests, focusing on area switching, persistence, and sequential order logic. Update code or tests as needed until all tests pass.
- After completing a feature create a pull request to `main` branch for code review and merging.
- Once merged, delete the feature branch to keep the repository clean.
