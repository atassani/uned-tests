# TASKS

Lightweight backlog for this repo (we keep it in the repo instead of GitHub Issues).

## How we use this file

- New ideas/bugs go into **Backlog** (with date + reporter).
- When we commit to doing something, move it to **Now** and set a priority.
- When finished, move it to **Done** (don’t delete it). Add PR/commit link or hash + completion date.
- AI agents: pick the **first item in “Now”** (top to bottom). If “Now” is empty, pick the first **P1** item in Backlog.

## Last number

- FEAT: 9
- BUG: 7
- TECH: 7

- **Status:** backlog
- **Priority:** P3
- **Reported:** 2025-01-16

## Backlog

### TEMPLATE

- **Status:** backlog
- **Priority:** [P1/P2/P3]
- **Reported:** YYYY-MM-DD
- **Reporter:** TT
- **Notes:**

### FEAT-008 — Make the questions directly clickable in MCQ quiz mode, instead of adding buttons

- **Status:** backlog
- **Priority:** P3
- **Reported:** 2025-01-22
- **Reporter:** TT
- **Notes:**

### FEAT-009 — Make the Answer page integrated to the question page, instead of a separate page, for True/False and MCQ modes

- **Status:** backlog
- **Priority:** P3
- **Reported:** 2025-01-22
- **Reporter:** TT
- **Notes:**

### FEAT-004 — Show the question in the grid when clicking

- **Status:** Backlog
- **Priority:** P3
- **Reported:** 2025-01-19
- **Notes:** When the status grid is shown, at the end of que quiz or when reviewing, clicking a question box should show that question immediately as information, not to answer it. If the question has been answered, it will also show the valid answer. In particular, I want to see in the final page after the test, when reviewing solutions, the question I got wrong, and go to their detail.

### TECH-004 — Move E2E tests to unit tests where possible

- **Status:** backlog
- **Priority:** P3
- **Reported:** 2025-01-20
- **Reporter:** TT
- **Notes:** It will speed up the test suite and make it less flaky. I am thinking, for instance, about sorting.

### TECH-005 — Standardize ESLint, Prettier, and TypeCheck with VSCode settings

- **Status:** backlog
- **Priority:** P3
- **Reported:** 2025-01-20
- **Reporter:** TT
- **Notes:** It will prevent a noisy VSCode or surprises when running prettier.

### TECH-006 — Instruct in AGENTS how to work with TASKS.md

- **Status:** backlog
- **Priority:** P3
- **Reported:** 2025-01-20
- **Reporter:** TT
- **Notes:** Will prevent mistakes and make it easier for agents to contribute. And not making a mess with the file.

### TECH-007 — Decide what to add to finished Tasks, PR, branch, commit…

- **Status:** backlog
- **Priority:** P3
- **Reported:** 2025-01-20
- **Reporter:** TT
- **Notes:** To document done features and to be able to track and revert, we need to record when things were done. But what is the best way? PR link, branch name, commit hash…?

### TECH-003 — Separate application from data

- **Status:** backlog
- **Priority:** P3
- **Reported:** 2025-01-17
- **Reporter:** TT
- **Notes:** Find a solution to separate app code from question data (e.g., JSON files). This would allow updating questions without redeploying the app.

### BUG-001 — Trailing slash required for /uned/studio route

- **Status:** backlog
- **Priority:** P1
- **Reported:** 2025-01-16
- **Reporter:** TT
- **Notes:** `/uned/studio` fails without trailing slash, but `/uned/studio/` works. Might be AWS/S3/CloudFront routing or Vercel rewrites.

### FEAT-006 — Sections in Section selection can have sub-sections, so I can click all exams, for instance, and see all their sections inside

- **Status:** backlog
- **Priority:** P3
- **Reported:** 2025-01-20
- **Reporter:** TT
- **Notes:** The could be named like "Section top name > Sub-section name", and clicking the top name would expand/collapse the list of sub-sections.

- **Test:** Added a regression test that sets localStorage to reproduce the failure; now passes.

## Notes for contributors

### Priority meanings

- **P1:** user-facing breakage / wrong data / blocks usage
- **P2:** important improvement, but workaround exists
- **P3:** nice-to-have / small UX / cleanup

### VS Code tips (to keep it “list-like”)

- Use the built-in folding:
  - **Fold all:** Cmd+K, Cmd+0 (Mac) / Ctrl+K, Ctrl+0 (Win/Linux)
  - **Unfold all:** Cmd+K, Cmd+J / Ctrl+K, Ctrl+J
  - **Fold level 1 (H1 only):** Cmd+K, Cmd+1 / Ctrl+K, Ctrl+1
- Use **Outline** view to navigate headings:
  - View → Open View… → **Outline**
- Use breadcrumbs for quick heading jumps:
  - View → Appearance → **Breadcrumbs**
- Extensions (optional):
  - **Markdown All in One** (better TOC, shortcuts, formatting)
  - **markdownlint** (keeps structure consistent)

### Rule of thumb for AI agents editing this file

- Don’t delete items when completed: move them to **Done**, add completion date + PR/commit.
- If you discover sub-tasks while implementing, add them under the same item as bullet notes (don’t explode the list).
